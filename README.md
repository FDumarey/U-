# U++
This is information about the Ultimate++ framework
The homepage of this wonderfull project can be found here: https://www.ultimatepp.org/index.html

# Framework
The U++ framework consists of CLANG compiler, assist, blitz and other C++ open-source tools, together with TheIDE, an IDE to build massive projects with an integrated designer for GUI layouts using widgets. What is great about this framework is that it is way better than the MFC from Microsoft (outdated by far), and the Clang compiler generates optimized assembler code (more performant then VisualC++ for example. The framework is also multi-platform: today there are tools for Windows and Linux, but they are also porting to MacOS.

## Reference cards
I made some reference cards for the framework in order to give you a kickstart when wanting to use the framework. I also added a reference card for SQL since I couldn't find something complete on the Internet. Certainly look at the documentation page on the site for all detailed information about the classes and functions: https://www.ultimatepp.org/www$uppweb$documentation$en-us.html

## Demo programs
There are a lot of code examples in the folders in order to let you see how easy it is to build native OS programs with native CPU speed, together with the native UI elements from recent OS like Windows 11.
There are also demo programs for numeric maths (see Math* folders).
